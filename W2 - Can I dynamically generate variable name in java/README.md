# Can I dynamically generate variable name in java?

I have an idea like this. eg. I have 2 strings: str1="Hello" and str2= "World"
Can I declare a variable named HelloWord from the sub strings str1+str2


I googled and found some languages can do that, but for java, the answer is NO.

If need a series of apple object, we just declare an array

	Apple[] apples = new Apple[10];
